    "   b) float\n",
    "   c) complex numbers\n",

    "   b) False\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1) numeric data type:\n",
    "In Python, numeric data type represent the data which has numeric value. Numeric value can be integer, floating number or even complex numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integers – This value is represented by int class. It contains positive or negative whole numbers (without fraction or decimal). In Python there is no limit to how long an integer value can be.\n",
    "\n",
    "Float – This value is represented by float class. It is a real number with floating point representation. It is specified by a decimal point. Optionally, the character e or E followed by a positive or negative integer may be appended to specify scientific notation.\n",

    "Complex Numbers – Complex number is represented by complex class. It is specified as (real part) + (imaginary part)j. For example – 2+3\n",

    "String\n",
    "In Python, Strings are arrays of bytes representing Unicode characters. A string is a collection of one or more characters put in a single quote, double-quote or triple quote. In python there is no character data type, a character is a string of length one. It is represented by str class.\n",

    "Data type with one of the two built-in values, True or False. Boolean objects that are equal to True are truthy (true), and those equal to False are falsy (false). But non-Boolean objects can be evaluated in Boolean context as well and determined to be true or false. It is denoted by the class bool."

    "An expression is a combination of operators and operands that is interpreted to produce some other value. In any programming language, an expression is evaluated as per the precedence of its operators. So that if there is more than one operator in an expression, their precedence decides which operation will be performed first. We have many different types of expressions in Python. Let’s discuss all types along with some exemplar codes :\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Constant Expressions: These are the expressions that have constant values only.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Arithmetic Expressions: An arithmetic expression is a combination of numeric values, operators, and sometimes parenthesis. The result of this type of expression is also a numeric value. The operators used in these expressions are arithmetic operators like addition, subtraction, etc. Here are some arithmetic operators in Python:\n",

    "//\tx // y\tQuotient\n",
    "%\tx % y\tRemainder\n",
    "**\tx ** y\tExponentiation\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Integral Expressions: These are the kind of expressions that produce only integer results after all computations and type conversions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Floating Expressions: These are the kind of expressions which produce floating point numbers as result after all computations and type conversions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Relational Expressions: In these types of expressions, arithmetic expressions are written on both sides of relational operator (> , < , >= , <=). Those arithmetic expressions are evaluated first, and then compared as per relational operator and produce a boolean output in the end. These expressions are also called Boolean expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Logical Expressions: These are kinds of expressions that result in either True or False. It basically specifies one or more conditions. For example, (10 == 9) is a condition if 10 is equal to 9. As we know it is not correct, so it will return False. Studying logical expressions, we also come across some logical operators which can be seen in logical expressions most often. Here are some logical operators in Python:\n",

    "not\tnot P\tIt returns true if condition P is false\n",

One way to think of this is that the purpose of an expression is to create a value (with some possible side-effects), while the sole purpose of a statement is to have side-effects."
